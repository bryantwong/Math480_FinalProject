Math 480 Final Project
====================

Introduction
------------

This project was done for [Math 480b](https://github.com/williamstein/sage2014) at the University of Washington, Spring 2014 by [Bryant Wong](https://github.com/bryantwong), [Yuki Sheng](https://github.com/syq2012), and Tony Xu>

The basic premise of our project is that we are interested in figuring out why different instruments sound different, i.e. what makes instruments have different timbres.
