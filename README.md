Math 480 Final Project
====================
**Introduction**

This project was done for Math 480b at the University of Washington, Spring 2014 by @bryantwong, @syq2014

The basic premise of our project is that we are interested in figuring out why different instruments sound different, i.e. what makes instruments have different timbres.
